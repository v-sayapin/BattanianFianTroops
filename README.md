# Battanian Fian Troops

Tiny XML-only mod for **Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord**.

Overrides Battania party templates:
- `kingdom_hero_party_battania_template`: Lords spawn with more «Fian» archer line troops:
  - 2–4 `battanian_highborn_youth`
  - 2–4 `battanian_highborn_warrior`
  - 0–1 `battanian_hero`
  - 0–1 `battanian_fian`
- `militia_battania_template`: Militia has a small chance (0–1) to include `battanian_highborn_youth`.

## Installation
Unpack or clone into `Mount & Blade II Bannerlord/Modules/`.

Enable **Battanian Fian Troops** in the launcher.

## Compatibility
XML-only, no dependencies like Harmony.

If another mod edits the same template IDs, the one **loaded last** wins.

## Supported game types
Campaign & Story Mode.
